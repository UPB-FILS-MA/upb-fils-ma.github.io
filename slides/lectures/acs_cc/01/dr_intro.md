## Questions for an engineer:

* What is inside a computing system?
* How do the components interact?
* How do I design a system that interacts with the physical environment?
* How do I choose the best hardware option for an embedded system?


## "Data-based decisions" â€“ based on IoT infrastructure require:

* Actual physical sensors
* Lots of IoT custom hardware
