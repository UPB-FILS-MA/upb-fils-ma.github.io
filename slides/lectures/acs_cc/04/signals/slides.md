# Signals
Analog vs Digital

<div grid="~ cols-2">

<div>

- *analog signals* are *real* signals
- *digital signals* are *a numerical representation* of an analog signal
- hardware usually works with two-level digital signals

#### Exceptions
- \>= 100Mbit Ethernet
- WiFi
- SSD storage

# Prevent Errors
using digital signals

<div grid="~ cols-2">

<div>

- use higher voltage
  - high noise margin 
  - higher power consumption ...
- lower noise by using better electronic circuits
- every device *samples and regenerates* the signal
