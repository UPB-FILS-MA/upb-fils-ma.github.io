# Memory Management
memory access defined page by page

- uses *logical addresses*
- **translates** to *physical addresses*

The processor works in at least two modes:
- **supervisor** mode 
  - restricts access to some registers 
  - accesses virtual addresses through Memory Protection (*if machine mode exists*)
- **user** mode 
  - allows only ALU and memory load and store
  - accesses memory access through the Memory Management Unit (*MMU*)

# Paging
the memory *unit* is the page

- Physical Memory (*RAM*) is divided in **frames**
- Logical Memory is divided in **pages**
- *page* = *frame* = **4 KB** (usually)

*logical addresses* are translated to *physical addresses* using a **page table**

the **page table** is located in the **physical memory**
  - <span color="red">each memory access requires at least memory 2 accesses</span>

<style>
.two-columns {
    grid-template-columns: 3fr 6fr;
}
</style>

# Address Translation
page to frame

the logic address is divided in two parts:
- *page index*
- *offset* within the page

the MMU translates every logic address into a physical address using a *page table*

<style>
.two-columns {
    grid-template-columns: 2fr 6fr;
}
</style>

# Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
caching address translation

<style>
.two-columns {
    grid-template-columns: 2fr 6fr;
}
</style>

the **page table** is **stored in RAM**

each memory access **requires 2 accesses**
1. read the page table entry to translate the address
2. the requested access

# Page Directory
caching address translation

<style>
.two-columns {
    grid-template-columns: 2fr 6fr;
}
</style>

$$ size_{table} = \frac{size_{ram}}{size_{page}}  $$

- each table entry is 4B
- the address space is 4GB (for 32 bits processors)

$$ size_{table\_32\_bits} = \frac{2^{32}}{4 \times 2^{10}}  $$

$$ size_{table\_32\_bits} = 4 MB $$

RAM was counted in MB when paging started being used

# Page Table Entry 
for x86 - 32 bits

<style>
img {
  background: #ffffff;
}
</style>

this is one entry of the page table
- **P** - is the page's frame present in RAM?
- **R/W** - read only or read write access
- **U/S** - can the page be accessed in user mode?
- **D** and **A** - has this page been written since the OS has reset these bits?
- **AVL** - bits available for the OS to use, ignored by MMU

# Page Table Entry
for x86 - 32 bits with PAE

<style>
img {
  background: #ffffff;
}
</style>

this is one entry of the page table using Physical Address Extension (*PAE*)
- **XD** - eXecute Disable (aka *DEP*), if set triggers a fault if an instruction is read from the page
- **PK** - Protection Keys, allows user mode to set protection (64 bit only)
