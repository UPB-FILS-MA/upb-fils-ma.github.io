# Why is the output not ideal?


### The two corresponding voltage output levels are affected by:

- power supply voltage
- output current 
- temperature 
- variations in the manufacturing process

# ICs same voltage


### Usually will work as is

- usually, they will be compatible
- conditions:
> V_OH_transmiter > V_IH_receiver

<br>

> V_OL_transmiter < V_IL_receiver

# VCC1 > VCC2


### Might work, might produce magic smock

- if
> V_OH_transmiter > VCC_receiver 

<b>  PROBLEM </b>

### Solutions:
- level shifter
- resistor divider / voltage limiter

# VCC1 < VCC2


### Might work

- if
> V_CC_transmiter close to VIH_receiver 

<b>  Might work in an intermittent mode - hard to debug!</b>

# Why Pull-Down R

- Without pull-down â€“ when the button is not pressed, it leaves the input pin floating.
- The second design ensures that the voltage level has a well-defined state, regardless of the button's state.
- R1 is called a "pull-down" resistor.

# Why Pull-Up R

- Same reasoning
- R1 is called a "pull-up" resistor.

##Obs:
- most microcontrollers have at least a pull-up resistor incorporated on GPIOs - that can be activated in software
- some have both pull-up and pull-down
- typically, these are sized for a 50 - 10 nA current consumption

# Notes on output pins

- most microcontrollers have a limit of around 10mA per output PIN
- ! do not connect an LED without a resistor in series )to limit the current) 
- ! do not connect a motor / any type of inductive load

## Solutions:
- use a transistor
- use an IC with incorporated Darlinghtons (eg: ULN2003)
