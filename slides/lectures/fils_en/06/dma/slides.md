- offloads the MCU from doing **memory to memory** operations
- due to MMIO, usually implies **transfers from and to peripherals**
- raises an interrupt when a transfer is done

⚠️ DMA does not know about the data stored in cache.

- for chips that use cache
  - the DMA buffer's memory region has to be set manually to *nocache* (if MCU knows)
  - or, the cache has to be flushed before and, possibly after, a DMA transfer
