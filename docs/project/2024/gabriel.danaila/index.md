## Description

The first microcontroller plays an WAV-coded audio file, modulating it in function of frequency over PWM, which is filtered by an RC Filter and then sent over a 3.5mm Jack to a JBL Speaker, which plays the analog audio. The audio volume is controlled by a potentiometer, not from the speaker. The potentiometer's value is read by another identical microcontroller over ADC, and then it is processed. The result (in ohms) is displayed on a 4-digit display. The Tesla coil can also be used to play audio, but it is not powerful enough for this task, so I decided to bring a fluorescent neon light and use the coil for powering the tube.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I think it is an interesting, innovative idea to put in practice, that is neither too easy or too complex to do for a single-person project. This project idea was brought to me by the lab teacher.

## Architecture 

The project has the following architecture:
- __Raspberry Pi Pico 1:__ The first Pico has the role of processing the digital audio to a pulse-width modulated analog signal, transmitting it over a GPIO pin.
- __RC Filter:__ The RC Filter is a simple circuit, formed out of a few resistors and capacitors, which filters out some of the noise out of the PWM signal. The output signal is clearer.
- __Potentiometer:__ The potentiometer is used to adjust the volume of the speaker.
- __JBL Speaker:__ Is used to play the analog signal.
- __Raspberry Pi Pico 2:__ The second Pico has the role of reading and processing the potentiometer's resistance. The processed data is then transmitted to the 4 digits display.
- __4 digits Display:__ Is used to display the potentiometer's resistance. 
- __Powerbank/Power Source:__ Is used to power the devices.
- __Cooling Fan:__ Is used to cool off the transistors used to power the Tesla coil.
- __Fluorescent Neon Tube:__ Turns electrical current into visible light.
- __PCB with Tesla Coil Soldered onto it:__ The PCB is used to generate an EMF used for powering up the fluorescent tube.

## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 6 - 12 May
Received first hardware parts. The Tesla Coil did not work so I ordered another one. First succesful tests with the PWM Audio code.
### Week 7 - 19 May
Received the second Tesla Coil, which, after some fixes from the lab teacher, started working but had a very low visual and acustical intensity. Decided to order other components and shift the project's focus a bit. After an intensive code testing session I decided to use two Pico microcontrollers for two separate purposes. The microcontrollers will both be placed on the same breadboard.
### Week 20 - 26 May
This week I finally received and assembled the last pieces of hardware. I have also realized that the potentiometer used had to be a logarithmic one, not linear. I also replaced the default beep.wav file with a longer audio file. I have replaced the hardware pictures, with newer, up to date, pictures. Updated the software library. Added an explanation for as why I have used 2 Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Hardware

I am using a Pico MCU in order to decode and send audio to a speaker, a potentiometer for adjustable volume, a secondary Pico MCU in order to process and send potentiometer's resistance value to a 4 digit display. Also, I will display a Tesla Coil which powers on a fluorescent neon tube wirelessly.

I am using two Pico MCUs because the code snippets and code parts that I use are made for either `embassy-rp` or `embedded-hal` specifically. This, on its own it is not the problem. The issue is that `embassy-rp`, at its core, is actually based on `embedded-hal`, both using one or more of the same packages. The pieces of code can be put together as one, without issues from `rust-analyzer`, but with issues from the compiler, which can't compile the same package twice. Theoretically, if all the code would be made to use only one `HAL Implementation`, it would work, but, the PWM audio, being written in bare metal, using unsafe methods, would be hard to switch into `embassy-rp`. On the other hand, switching the LED part of the code (which is in embassy-rp) would be equally as hard, if we would want to keep the same functionalities. These being said, the most optimal way I found was to `split` the code based on the implementation used, with the PWM Audio being based on bare metal `embedded-hal` and the LED->ADC part being based on `embassy-rp`. As such, the Pico MCUs, each run its own `HAL Implementation`.
