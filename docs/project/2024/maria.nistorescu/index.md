## Description

The project is about a smart door lock system using Raspberry Pi Pico W. 
The door can be unlocked in 3 ways: RFID MODULE, SENSORS( knock knock_ knock knock ), WEB APPLICATION ( turn on/ off).
I intend to make a function that sends me back an e-mail which says how many times the door was unlocked in a day. Incredible, right?

## Motivation

Why did I choose this project?

Well, I went in a trip to Italy 2 months ago and I stayed to an airbnb that had a smart door lock system with password.

I knew about the project at school, and at that moment seemed very interesting to me the idea of a digital lock.
So I wanted to implement it and, maybe use it every day life.

## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 6 - 12 May
In this week, I tried to find more resources regarding to the mobile application I intend to make in order to unlock the door.

### Week 7 - 19 May
In this week, I finally finished the hardware part, including the kicad schematics.

### Week 20 - 26 May


## Hardware

- *Raspberry Pi Pico W (microcontroller):* The main control unit for the smart door lock system, responsible for processing data, running the necessary functions, and communicating with other components.
  
- *RFID MODULE (for unlocking the door):* Reads RFID tags/cards to allow authorized access through the smart door lock system.
  
- *TTP223:* Capacitive touch sensor used for touch-based inputs, such as entering a code to unlock the door.
  
- *2N2222:* NPN transistor that may be used for switching purposes in the circuit, such as controlling the relay module or other components.
  
- *BUZZER 5V:* Emits an audible alert, like a beep or chime, to provide feedback when the door is unlocked or in case of an error.
  
- *RELAY MODULE:* Controls the electronic door lock mechanism, allowing the microcontroller to trigger the locking or unlocking of the door.
  
- *ELECTRONIC DOOR LOCK:* The physical locking mechanism that secures the door, controlled by the relay module based on input from the microcontroller.
  
- *Power Supply 12V:* Supplies the necessary power to the components in the system, ensuring they function properly.
  
- *Module DC-DC Step Down LM2596S  (connected to power supply):* Regulates the 12V power supply to provide lower voltage levels required by certain components in the system, such as the Raspberry Pi Pico W.


### Schematics

Shortly, I am going to admit that the KICAD schematics took me with all the coffee breaks included, somewehere around 16-20h :) ;
Also, I tried to make the schematics clearer and maybe, help me to notice, if u notice some other mistakes.

Legend of the KICAD schematics:
U1  represents the RFID;
U2  represents the SENSOR TOUCH;
U4  represents the LM5296S;
U6  represents the POWER SUPPLY;
U7  represents the LOCK;
U8  represents the RELAY MODULE;

Q1 is NPN transistor 2N2222.
