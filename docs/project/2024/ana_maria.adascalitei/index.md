## Description

My project aims to keep track on the plants effortlessly. It provides comprehensive tracking of evironmental parameters such as soil moisture, ph levels, if there any bugs on the plant or inside it, but also ambient temperature and light intesity. By this, you can have optimal care for your plant and ensure the thrive of it with minimal effort.

## Motivation

The occasions when I've neglected plant care, or when my mother overlooked unfavorable room temperatures for plants, inspired me to seek a more convenient method for plant maintenance and reminders for when care is forgotten.

## Architecture 

Main components: 

Raspberry Pi Pico W - This is the microcontroller I will use for this project. It is responsible for gathering data from the sensors, processing it, and sending it to the server (which will eventually send it to the app).

Server - A component that receives the data from the microcontroller and stores it in a database. It will also send it to the app.

App - A mobile application that receives the data from the servers and informs the user about the plant. It will send alerts in case the plant needs water or if there should be a change in the plant's location.

SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR, HYGROMETER - It measures the soil moisture to determine if the plant needs water.

BMP180 Temperature and Pressure sensor module - This component provides crucial environmental data by measuring both temperature and atmospheric pressure. By monitoring changes in atmospheric pressure, we can detect alterations in weather patterns or room conditions, such as sudden temperature drops or fluctuations in air pressure, which could impact plant health and growth.

Ambient light sensor TEMT6000 -  This component will help us realize if there is enough light in the place for the plant during the day. If not, we will change the location.

Analogue Piezoelectric Vibration Sensor - This component detects vibrations. These vibrations will determine whether a bug has entered the plant or if a pet has disturbed the soil.

DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module - This will give us the temperature and humidity of the place where the plant is. The temperature is not really needed since we already have BMP180, but the humidity will tell us if the place is humid enough.

The sensors from both the plant (humidity, vibration) and from the room (light, pressure, temperature, humidity) will be connected directly to the Raspberry Pi Pico W. The data will then be sent to the server and finally to the app.

The microcontroller is connected to a power supply so we can continuously receive data about the conditions of the plant.
