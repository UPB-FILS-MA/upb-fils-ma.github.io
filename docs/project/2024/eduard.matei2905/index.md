## Description

Obstacltron is an obstacle avoider robot built using Raspberry Pi Pico W. It utilizes an L298N motor driver, DC motors, and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to create a simple yet effective robot that can navigate its environment autonomously by detecting and avoiding obstacles. This project aims to showcase practical applications of robotics and sensor integration while providing a platform for experimentation and learning.

## Architecture

* Raspberry Pi Pico W: Chosen as the microcontroller unit due to its affordability and versatility.

* L298N Motor Driver: Responsible for controlling the DC motors, offering bidirectional control and allowing precise manipulation of the robot's movement.

* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: Serves as the primary sensor for obstacle detection, utilizing ultrasonic waves to measure distances accurately.

* DC Motors: These motors are the driving force behind the robot's movement, enabling it to navigate its environment.

### Components
- Raspberry Pi Pico W: Microcontroller unit
- L298N Motor Driver: Controls the DC motors
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects obstacles
- DC Motors: Drive the robot's movement

### Connection
- Raspberry Pi Pico W and L298N Motor Driver are connected via GPIO pins.
- The DC motors are connected to the output terminals of the L298N Motor Driver.
- The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor is connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
