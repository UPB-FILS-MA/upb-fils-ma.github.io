## Description

My idea is to have the ability to play user-friendly games-such as Snake or the one with the dinosaur on Chrome, when you don't have a connection- on a tiny and simple game console. It consists in a breadboard, where's attached the Raspberry Pi, a LCD screen, a LED to show if the console is powered on or off and the buttons. There's one for the velocity and four for left/right/up/down, similarly to a regular gaming console or just one for going up(based on what game I'm going to write I'll either put one button or four). 

## Motivation

I've decided to choose this project, because ever since I was a kid, I've used to play video games and I've told myself that I'll learn how to make one from scratch. On top of that, for many years my desire for playing has been decreasing, because even though I like the games, I'm getting bored of them, so I want to create one at some point, that keeps me playing it. To sum up, I want to make this as my project, because I want to understand the basics of game development, in order to actually start designing and developing my own game. 

## Architecture 

In the end, my project will consist of a Raspberry Pi Pico W, a LCD screen, a LED and buttons, all
    * on the LCD the game is going to be displayed
    * the LED will show if the console is powered on or off
    * the buttons will be used to control the game
