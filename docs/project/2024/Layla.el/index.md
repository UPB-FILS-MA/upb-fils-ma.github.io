## Description
The project revolves around a multi-storey parking lot. At the entrance, an infrared sensor will detect the presence of vehicles. After the detection of a vehicle a servomotor barrier will allow its entry. Infrared sensors will be implanted at each parking lot to monitor occupation.There will be green leds indicating available parking spaces, and red ones indicating occupancy.The second floor will be designated for authorized vehicles only.To make this happen, an RFID system will be utilized. In case an unauthorized vehicle tries to access, a buzzer will be activated alerting security personnel. When an authorized vehicle is detected, an LED light will turn on. The exit will also implement an infrared sensor and a servomotor barrier. A flame sensor will indicate the presence of fire, in case of fire a buzzer will be activated and the servomotors will automatically open to enable evacuation procedures.

## Motivation
These days, cars have become a necessity rather than a luxury. People rely on them for their everyday activities, whether it's going to work, running errands, or simply enjoying some leisure time. One major concern for them is finding a place to park wherever they go. Whether it's for work, fun, or shopping, having a convenient and safe parking space is crucial for their comfort and peace of mind.
I picked this project because it addresses this concern. My project focuses on making parking lots safer, ensuring a better parking experience for everyone.

## Architecture 
![A prototype of architecture](Architecture.png)

This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico W to create a smart parking system, housed within a cardboard box. The system features two floors, with various sensors and components managing the parking spaces.

### Components Overview

#### First Floor

- **Parking Areas**:
  - **3 parking spaces**, each equipped with:
    - **Green LED**: Indicates the space is available.
    - **Red LED**: Indicates the space is occupied.
    - **Infrared Sensor**: Detects presence of cars.

- **Gates**:
  - **Entrance Gate**: Controlled by **Servomotor 1** (connected to GPIO pin 1).
  - **Exit Gate**: Controlled by **Servomotor 2** (connected to GPIO pin 2).

- **Sensors**:
  - **Infrared Sensors**: 5 sensors (PIR 1 to PIR 5) monitoring vehicle movements, connected to GPIO pins 6-10. 3 senzors indicate if a car is parked in a parking space, while 2 of them are used to indicate cars for gates (servomotors) to open.
  - **IR Flame Sensor**: Detects fire and triggers a buzzer, connected to GPIO pin 3.

#### Second Floor

- **Authorized Parking Area**:
  - **RFID RC522**: Controls access to the area, communicates with the Pico W via SPI:
    - **SCK**: GPIO 18
    - **MISO**: GPIO 16
    - **MOSI**: GPIO 19
    - **CS**: GPIO 17
  - **LED Light**: Indicates access status.

### Connectivity

- **Infrared Sensors**: Connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico W's GPIO pins, sending signals about vehicle presence.
- **Servo Motors**: Controlled by pins on the Pico W.
- **LEDs**: Indicate parking space and authorization status.
- **Fire Sensor**: Activates a buzzer when triggered.
- **RFID**: Communicates via SPI with the Pico W, controlling access and indicating status with an LED.
- **Active buzzer**: the buzzer that gets activated in case of a fire.
  

### Physical Layout

- **Cardboard Box**: Houses the system, with cutouts for each component:
  - **First Floor**: 3 parking spaces, entrance, and exit.
  - **Second Floor**: Authorized parking area.
- **Breadboard**: Hidden inside, connecting all components to the Pico W.

### Week 6 - 12 May

### Week 7 - 19 May

### Week 20 - 26 May

## Hardware
- *Infrared Flame sensor*: I used this to detect any nearby fires.
- *Active buzzer module*: This buzzer is activated when the flame sensor detects fire, or when rfid detects unauthorised car.
- *Servomotor*: Used as a barrier.
- *Infrared sensor*: Two of them are used with the servomotors, they indicate nearby cars so that the servo barrier opens. Three of them are used to detect if parking spaces are occupied or not.
- *Rfid module*: I used it to differ between authorised and unauthorised cars. Authorised have a recognised card attached to it, the unauthorised ones will have a different card attached.
- *Green leds*: used to indicate free parking spots.
- *Red leds*: used to indicate occupied parking spots.

### Schematics
![Kicad schematic where the pins are connected directly to pico  but the ground and vcc are not](kicad1.png)
![Kicad schematic where everything is connected to the raspberry pico](Kicad2.png)
In kicad1, for simplicity I put ground and vcc, not connecting them directly. 
In kicad2, everything is connected properly.
