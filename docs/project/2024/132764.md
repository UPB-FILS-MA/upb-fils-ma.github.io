## Description

Describe in a few words your project idea.

Introduction

A rudimentary GamePad constructed on a breadboard serves as a functional prototype to test within various gaming environments. This DIY controller operates on the Windows XInput API, allowing the system to recognize it as an Xbox controller, thereby facilitating seamless integration with a wide range of games that support Xbox controller inputs. The underlying electronics and wiring are carefully assembled on a breadboard, providing a flexible platform for development and testing.

Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to assess input latency across different gaming scenarios. By using this GamePad, which mimics the functionality of a standard Xbox controller, researchers can measure the time delay between user input and corresponding in-game actions. The experiment aims to gather data on input latency across a variety of platforms, including different operating systems, computer configurations, and monitor types. This information can help identify factors that contribute to input lag and inform hardware and software optimization strategies to improve gaming responsiveness.
Testing environment

In addition to the breadboard GamePad, an official Xbox Series controller (plus PlayStation because why not) is included for comparative analysis. By conducting parallel tests with the DIY controller and the Xbox Series controller, researchers can evaluate how closely the breadboard-built GamePad matches the performance and responsiveness of a commercially available controller. This comparative approach provides a baseline to assess whether the homemade controller exhibits any additional latency or other unexpected behavior.

Conclusions

Basically, this project has both a technical and practical focus: it explores the construction and functionality of a custom-built controller, while simultaneously addressing broader questions related to gaming performance, user experience, and system optimization. The findings from this study could have implications for gamers, developers, and hardware manufacturers interested in minimizing input latency and enhancing gameplay fluidity.



## Motivation

As it can be probably guessed from the above paragraphs, I am want to combine 2 subjects which are on opposite measurement axis (creativity and art with engineering projects). I believe that this project will help me understand how much time and effort developpers and engineers put when designing even just a little piece of the hardware part for the console or computer. Moreover, I'm keen on challenges and I wish to learn Rust as a new and innovative programming language, in comparison I come from Java langaguage so Rust might be the perfect mix for me for C/C++ and Java. Furthermore (and last idea I promise) I want to create a small presentation involving statistics and measuring data to show that projects can be done in an equal rhythm with fun, creativity and hard work.

## Architecture 

Add here the schematics with the architecture of your project. Make sure to include:
 - what are the main components (architecture components, not hardware components)
 - how they connect with each other

Here is a small diagram of all the connections (i think) should be neccessary for the controller. I'll also try to describe it in words. Hopefully will make sense.

Main Components

Controller Interface
This is the collection of user input elements, including buttons, joysticks, and directional pads. It's what the user interacts with to control the game.
Signal Processing
This component receives input signals from the controller interface and translates them into data that the microcontroller can process. In this case, it includes the voltage dividers for button groupings.

Microcontroller
The central component responsible for processing input data, managing the XInput API communication, and handling USB communication. The Raspberry Pi Pico W is used for this project.

USB Interface
This is the connection point between the microcontroller and the host system (e.g., a Windows computer). It allows the controller to be recognized as an XInput device.

XInput Communication
This component encapsulates the interaction between the microcontroller and the host system through the XInput API. It translates input signals into a format that games can understand.

Connections

Controller Interface to Signal Processing
The input components (buttons, joysticks, etc.) are connected to the signal processing unit. Voltage dividers are used to group certain buttons, reducing the number of required digital pins.

Signal Processing to Microcontroller
The processed signals are sent to the microcontroller for further handling. The microcontroller is responsible for interpreting the inputs and sending appropriate responses to the host system.

Microcontroller to USB Interface
The microcontroller connects to the USB interface, which allows it to communicate with the host system. This connection enables the controller to be recognized as an XInput device.

Microcontroller to XInput Communication
The microcontroller sends input data to the host system using the XInput API. This component ensures that the controller's input is properly formatted and recognized by compatible games.
