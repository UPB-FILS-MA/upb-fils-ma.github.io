## Description

The controller is a breadboard with 16 buttons and two thumbsticks that will connect to the PC and be recognized by Windows 10 and 11 as an Xbox One Controller by making use of official Windows API. This prototype will be tested in various games that range from FPSs to racing and 3rd person action-adventure. The display of the Pico will be used to display debug information such as the buttons pressed and the X and Y coordinates of the joysticks when in use.

## Motivation

I have an Xbox One X console with two controllers. A friend of mine borrowed one and sometimes he forgets to bring it with him when I host FIFA tournaments. This prototype will serve as a backup for when he forgets to bring the controller.
