## Description:

A fire alarm system trigerred by a fire source or other sort of light source in the proximity. It includes the following features:
- Detection of the fire using a Flame Sensor.
- Activating a buzzer alarm when fire is detected.
- Displaying a warning message on a LCD display.

## Motivation
For my first embedded project I wanted to do something usefull for the everyday life and also to practice all the skills that I gained at the laboratory and at the course, and so I choose to  develop a reliable and cost-effective fire alarm system using Raspberry Pi Pico that can detect and alert users in case of fire emergencies.

## Arhitecture
The architecture of the project is the following:
1	Raspberry Pi Pico W: Microcontroller unit responsible for processing and controlling the system.
2. ST7789 Display: Display module for visual notifications and system status.
3. Fire Sensor: Detects the presence of fire or smoke.
4. Buzzer: Audible alarm for alerting users.
5. Power Supply: Provides power to the Raspberry Pi Pico and peripherals.

### Week 6 - 12 May

### Week 7 - 19 May

### Week 20 - 26 May

## Hardware:

1. Raspberry Pi Pico Board – 1
2. 16×2 I2C LCD Display – 1
3. Flame Sensor – 1
4. Breadboard – 1
5. RGB LED Module – 1
6. Jumper Wires – 10
7. Micro-USB Cable – 1
9. Buzzer - 1

## Connection Overview:
* The fire sensor is connected to one of the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi Pico for detecting fire or smoke.
* The buzzer is connected to another GPIO pin to sound the alarm when triggered.
* The ST7789 display is connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico via SPI for displaying system status and alerts.
* Power supply is connected to Raspberry Pi Pico for powering the entire system.
