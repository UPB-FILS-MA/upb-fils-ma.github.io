## Description

RustPlayer is a custom-built MP3 player utilizing a Raspberry Pi Pico W to allow users to play music directly from a microSD card, controlled through a simple interface of buttons and an OLED display. Some laboratories I found relevent for the project I am implementing, are: 
- Lab 3: Interfacing SPI devices
- Lab 5: I2S Audio
- Lab 7: Advanced I/O Interfaces


## Motivation

My passion for music and technology inspired me to want to create the RustPlayer. This project is a perfect opportunity to apply my technical skills in a meaningful way, combining my love for tunes with the challenge of programming and hardware design. I'm excited to develop a device that not only plays music but also reconnects people with the tactile joy of manually choosing songs—something that's lost in today’s streaming era. Building the RustPlayer is also an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of embedded systems and user interface design, which are crucial in my studies and future career in technology.

## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 6 - 12 May

The schematic for the project has been successfully created using KiCad. This schematic includes all necessary components and connections for the electronic circuit. Detailed component selection was finalized, and precise connections were established to ensure optimal functionality.

### Week 7 - 19 May

A 3D model of the project enclosure has been designed using Tinkercad. The box is tailored to fit all components securely and includes cutouts for the buttons, display, RGB LED, and speaker. Special attention was given to the layout to ensure ease of assembly and accessibility for future maintenance.

### Week 20 - 26 May

   The software development phase began. The microcontroller was programmed to interface with and control the various components of the project. Initial tests were conducted to ensure basic functionality.

   User interface enhancements were implemented. Additional testing and debugging were carried out to ensure seamless interaction between all components.

   Comprehensive documentation was created, covering the design, assembly, and software integration processes. The project was prepared for the final review and deployment.

## Hardware

The Raspberry Pi Pico W serves as the central microcontroller for the RustPlayer project. It provides the processing power and interfaces necessary to control various components of the music player. With its dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor and ample GPIO pins, the Pico W can handle tasks such as reading input from buttons, interfacing with the MicroSD card module for storing and accessing MP3 files, driving the OLED display for the user interface, and controlling the audio output via the MAX98357A amplifier.

This is the current progress of the RustPlayer project. So far, the essential components have been assembled. The next step involves making the music player more compact by integrating all components into a custom-designed box with a lid. This enclosure will be created using Tinkercad to ensure a perfect fit.
