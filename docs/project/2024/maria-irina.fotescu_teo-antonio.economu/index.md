## Description

We are looking to have a clock that presents the current time and the temperature on a LCD 1602 which has an I2C interface. We will set a certain threshold on the sensor. If the temperature surpases this limit, the buzzer will start ringing and the cooler will try to cool down the sensor in order to bring the temperature back to optimal levels. In order for us to be informed about the temperature increase, the display will show a warning message and the buzzer will start ringing once the threshold is reached. For a very accurate measurement, we are going to use the Kalman Filter.

## Motivation

We are both loving mathematics, so the idea of combining complex mathematics with the Rust language and all the hardware part really drives us and keeps us going forward in pursuing an amazing project.

### Week 12 - 17 May

So far, we managed to do everything related to the hardware part and almost finding a way to fix the display on the 3D print. On the journey to finish this milestone we've faced some difficulties when it came to realizing a perfect scheme in Thinkercad, but in the end we managed to do it not just on point, but also with the fan perfectly centered above the temperature sensor so the cooling part it's made as efficient as possible. We are excited to start the software part as soon as possible!

### Week 6 - 12 May

### Week 7 - 19 May

### Week 20 - 26 May

## Hardware

### Short description

The hardware utilized includes a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, a breadboard as the main board, an LCD 1602 with I2C Interface for display, a Barometric BMP280 GY pressure sensor, a buzzer, and various connectors along with an 80mm cooler.
