## Description

An alarm system based on motion detection, featuring audio and visual feedback and a time log displayed on an LCD screen. This system uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W to process input from a PIR motion 
sensor to detect presence and activate alerts.

## Motivation

This project was chosen to explore practical applications of embedded systems in security, utilizing motion detection to develop a reliable, low-cost alarm system suitable for residential 
properties. It aims to provide an intuitive system for enhancing home security.

## Architecture 

The system architecture comprises a Raspberry Pi Pico W, which serves as the central processing unit. It is connected to an HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor for detecting movement. Upon detection, the 
microcontroller triggers an audio alarm (buzzer), a light alarm (LED's) and displays the activation time on the LCD. The button inputs allow for system reset.

## Hardware

The Motion-based Alarm System leverages essential electronic components designed to interact seamlessly for effective monitoring and alerting functions:

- Raspberry Pi Pico W: Acts as the central processing unit of the system, handling the computation and control logic. It processes signals from sensors and manages outputs to other devices.
- HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor: This sensor detects infrared signals from moving objectsor people, triggering the alarm system when motion is detected within its field of view.
- LCD: Displays the time of the "break-in".
- Buzzer: This will produce the actual alram sound, prividign the audio feedback
- LED's: The LED's will light up at the same time when the buzzer activates, prividing visual feed-back.
- Buttons: Used for user input and allow for manual resetting of the alarm.
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires: Provide platform for prototyping the circuit, facilitating easy setup and adjustments.
- Resistors: Ensure proper functioning of the circuit, as well as protect sensitive components from excessive current and manage voltage levels.
