## Description

This project investigates how attackers can manipulate sensor data in networked IoT-like systems.  Using two Raspberry Pi Pico W devices connected to a laptop over WiFi, it simulates how an attacker can intercept sensor readings, modify them, and send falsified data back to the laptop. The goal is to implement these attacks and explore potential strategies for detecting data manipulation. This project highlights the critical need for security measures in sensor-based systems.

## Motivation

My interest in cybersecurity stems from its technical complexity and the direct implications for system integrity.  Understanding attack vectors at the level of microprocessor architecture, specifically how an attacker could manipulate data flows or exploit vulnerabilities, is crucial for designing robust defenses.  I chose this project because it provides a tangible way to explore these threats by simulating attacks on a sensor-equipped embedded system. Developing and implementing countermeasures allows me to directly apply concepts from my Microprocessor Arhitecture coursework to safeguard the system. This hands-on experience will prove invaluable as I pursue a career focused on cybersecurity.

## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 6 - 12 May
This past week, I focused on gathering the essential components for my project, successfully acquiring most of the items needed. In addition to sourcing materials, I dedicated time to researching online, seeking inspiration to refine my concept. After careful consideration and exploration of various ideas, I finalized the project idea that I plan to implement. This dual approach of preparation and planning has set a solid foundation for the next stages of my project.

### Week 7 - 19 May
In the second week of my project, I completed several key tasks. I gathered all necessary materials and created multiple KiCad schematics. I developed a detailed schematic with wiring for the facility Pico, a cleaner schematic showing only port connections, and a fully wired schematic for the attacker Pico. I also constructed the hardware components on breadboards and the Pico Explorer board, allowing for real-life testing and refinement of the designs. Also, I have created the ST7789 driver symbol for the attacker Pico, added the HC-SR04 symbol and footprint and modified a symbol for the 4 digit 7 segment display in order to match the one I have.

### Week 20 - 26 May
This week, I successfully created runnable code for two Raspberry Picos: the Attacker Pico and the Facility Pico. I implemented code to enable the Facility Pico to act as a server and the Attacker Pico to function as a client. Additionally, I developed defensive mechanisms for the Facility Pico and designed unrecognizable attacks from the Attacker Pico. A significant portion of my time was dedicated to resolving issues with new dependencies. I was challenged by the complexity, which was higher than I anticipated, but it provided valuable learning experiences and growth in handling intricate systems. Now, having learned from my mistakes, I will have a better approximation of future projects' complexity and be more prepared to tackle them efficiently.
