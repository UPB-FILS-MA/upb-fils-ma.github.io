## Description

This project investigates how attackers can manipulate sensor data in networked IoT-like systems.  Using two Raspberry Pi Pico W devices connected to a laptop over WiFi, it simulates how an attacker can intercept sensor readings, modify them, and send falsified data back to the laptop. The goal is to implement these attacks and explore potential strategies for detecting data manipulation. This project highlights the critical need for security measures in sensor-based systems.

## Motivation

My interest in cybersecurity stems from its technical complexity and the direct implications for system integrity.  Understanding attack vectors at the level of microprocessor architecture, specifically how an attacker could manipulate data flows or exploit vulnerabilities, is crucial for designing robust defenses.  I chose this project because it provides a tangible way to explore these threats by simulating attacks on a sensor-equipped embedded system. Developing and implementing countermeasures allows me to directly apply concepts from my Microprocessor Arhitecture coursework to safeguard the system. This hands-on experience will prove invaluable as I pursue a career focused on cybersecurity.
