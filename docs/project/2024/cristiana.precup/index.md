## Description

This project aims to develop a radar-like security system using a Raspberry Pi Pico W as its core. Designed to monitor and track the presence of objects within a specified perimeter, the system utilizes ultrasonic sensing technology to detect movements or intrusions. Objects within the sensor's range will be displayed on a computer through a graphical interface similar to naval radars, and there will be a visual and acoustic notification system. It will also provide data about the detected objects, including their distance and speed.

## Motivation

I chose this radar security system project because it combines practical engineering with advanced technology to address significant security issues, including military needs. Using a Raspberry Pi Pico W and ultrasonic sensors, this system mimics the radar used in submarines and aircraft for everyday safety and military surveillance. Additionally, I am implementing this system using the Rust programming language, which offers enhanced safety and performance features ideal for such critical applications. This project not only challenges my technical skills but also allows me to develop a tool that enhances safety in various environments, such as homes, warehouses, and military zones. It offers a valuable chance to deepen my understanding of hardware-software integration and contribute to creating safer, more secure areas with innovative technology.

## Architecture 

Main Components:\
Sensor Module: This includes the Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, which measures the proximity of objects. It is mounted on the Micro Servo Motor, allowing the sensor to pivot and scan a wider area.\
Control Unit: The Raspberry Pi Pico W acts as the brain of the system. It controls the Sensor Module, processes the distance data, operates the Servo Motor, and manages user interactions through buttons.

Feedback Mechanisms:\
Visual Feedback: Delivered by the RGB LED, which changes color to indicate different system statuses or alerts.\
Auditory Feedback: The Passive Buzzer produces sound alerts when movement is detected or under specific conditions.\

User Interface: Consists of Tactile Push Button Switches that allow users to manually operate the system.\
Display Interface: A laptop connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico W via Wi-Fi. It displays the radar data graphically, mimicking naval radar systems, and provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring.

Connections Between Components:\
Sensor to Controller: The Ultrasonic Sensor is connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico W through GPIO pins, sending back data to the microcontroller for analysis.\
Servo Motor to Controller: The Servo Motor is connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico W, receiving commands to adjust the sensor’s orientation for comprehensive scanning.\
Feedback to Controller: Both the RGB LED and the Passive Buzzer are linked to the Pico W, which activates these elements based on the processed data to provide alerts.\
User Interface to Controller: The push buttons are wired to GPIO pins on the Pico W, enabling direct user control and configuration changes.
