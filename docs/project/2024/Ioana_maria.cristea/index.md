## Description

A fan that monitors and displays the temperature and pressure in the room on a LCD screen, then activates the fan after a certain threshold :


+ The system utilizes a sensor to detect both temperature and pressure.

+ The LCD screen showcases the temperature and pressure readings.

+ The fan is triggered once the threshold is exceeded.

+ A buzzer is activated once the threshold is surpassed.

+ After the threshold is exceeded, the fan's arm oscillates from side to side.


## Motivation

**This project** holds a special significance for me because it allowed me to bridge the gap between theory and practice. Throughout my time in the laboratory, I gained valuable insights into the fundamentals of electronics and programming. However, there were certain aspects that I didn't have the chance to explore fully.

By undertaking the development of a smart fan, I saw an opportunity to not only apply the knowledge I acquired in the lab but also to expand my skill set in areas that were previously uncharted territory for me. Combining hardware with software was a challenge I eagerly embraced, and through this project, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in integrating the two seamlessly.

## Architecture 
The **Raspberry Pi Pico** serves as the central control unit, directing and managing all other components utilized within the project.


The **LCD** serves as an interface for showcasing the sensor readings, it is connected to the Pico through I2C

The **servomotor** is connected to an improvised arm, allowing the fan to rotate 90Â° in either direction.

The **buzzer**, when the temperature threshold is surpassed, emits an  alarm, acting as an alert mechanism.

The **pressure and temperature** sensor detects changes in temperature and pressure, supplying input to the Pico.

A **DC Motors** that controls the fan
