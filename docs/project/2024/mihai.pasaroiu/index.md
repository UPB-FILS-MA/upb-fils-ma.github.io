## Description

This project is a compact music player built with a Raspberry Pi Pico W and programmed in Rust. It uses an SPI-connected microSD module to read songs, playing them through a speaker with an amplifier for clear audio output. The music will be outputted as PWM through a speaker. The user interface consists of push buttons for basic controls (next song, previous song, and play/pause), a potentiometer for smooth volume adjustment, and an I2C LCD screen that displays the current song's title. 
Additionally, a set of PWM-controlled LEDs offers a dynamic visual representation of the music's intensity, with brightness varying based on the PWM duty cycle of the audio output to the speaker.

## Motivation

Building a music player with a Raspberry Pi Pico W using Rust allowed me to work on a project that I could personally enjoy, while also learning valuable skills in microcontroller programming and hardware integration. I like to listen to music, and it seemed interesting to create a project that combines technology with something I love. Plus, it's a great way to make something cool that I can show off to my friends.
