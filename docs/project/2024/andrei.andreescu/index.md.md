## Description

i want to make a project that activates a system alarm when something enters in a zone where is a movement sensor a laser sensor and a light sensor and then it gives me an email with the the time spend in the zone at the time that the alarm activated 

## Motivation

for me an alarm sistem is very interesting so for me to do one is absolutly grandious

Raspberry Pi Pico W (SC0918): Microcontroller board based on the RP2040 microcontroller chip.

APDS-9960 Light Sensor: Digital RGB, ambient light, and gesture sensor with I2C interface.

VL53L0X Distance Laser Sensor: Time-of-flight (ToF) laser-ranging sensor for measuring distances with an I2C interface.

RGB LED: Light-emitting diode capable of producing various colors, typically with common cathode/anode configuration.

Buzzer: Electromechanical component that produces sound when activated, usually by applying an alternating current.
