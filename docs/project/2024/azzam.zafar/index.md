## Description

  - I will use an Ultrasonic sensor to detect an object, and to see how close an object is to the sensor. Based on how close the object is, certain actions will happen.

  - When the sensor will detect an object within a specific range (e.g., 100 cm) an LED will light up. If the object gets even closer to the sensor (e.g., 60 cm) the LED will remain lit and a buzzer (alarm) will start buzzing. And when the object comes even closer ( e.g., less than or equal to 30cm), the LED will remain lit and the buzzer will keep buzzing and two servo motors (with carboard attached) will rotate 90 degrees (one servo motor will rotate clockwise, the other servo motor will rotate anticlockwise) to show a closing gate.

  - If the object starts moving away, and moves beyond a specific distance (e.g., 30 cm) from the sensor, the two servo motors will rotate back to their initial state, but the buzzer will keep buzzing, and the LED will remain lit. If the object keeps moving further away and moves beyond another specific distance (e.g., 60 cm), the buzzer will stop buzzing but the LED will remain lit. And finally, when the object moves further away (e.g., more than 100 cm), the LED will turn off.

  - An LCD will be constantly displaying the distance between the object and the sensor.

## Motivation

I decided on this idea because of its real world applications. This project is an inexpensive and portable method of identifying intrusion in an area. The initiative aims to raise awareness of health and safety issues, particularly in enclosed environments, by utilizing the Raspberry Pi Pico's capabilities. With the help of this gadget, users can be informed about any risks in real time and be equipped to act quickly. In the end, people's living and working conditions become safer.

## Hardware

  - I'm using the Raspberry Pi Pico WH development board, which has the RP2040 microcontroller chip that handles processing and interfaces with every piece of hardware.

  - Using female-to-male and male-to-male jumper wires, components will be connected via a breadboard.

  - Object detection and distance measurement will be handled by the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor. Various states will be indicated by; a monochromatic LED that is connected with a 1K resistor to limit the current, a Buzzer, and two SG90 Servo motors.

  - An LCD will be used to display the distance of the object in real-time.

  - The complete system can be powered on a 9V battery, which makes the system portable andÂ independent.
