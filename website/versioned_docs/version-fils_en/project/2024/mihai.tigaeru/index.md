## Description

This projects resembles the classic Snake Game from the old Nokia phones, having the same rules and mechanics. You control the Snake using a 2-axis joystick. Your score is updated live on a 4 digit display, that goes until 9999. For every interaction with "food", there is a buzzer which will play a sound. If you hit yourself, it's game over and you have to start again. You can also pass through walls. The game itself is displayed on an actual Nokia 5110 LCD display. Good luck and enjoy!

## Motivation

I've chosen this project mainly because I've always wanted to create a fully functional game from zero, including hardware and I've always liked the idea of retro-themed stuff. Also, by looking on the internet and finding out that there's actual Nokia displays that can be easily used with microcontrollers I've instantly thought about one of the most popular Nokia games, Snake, and how cool it would be to recreate it using Rust.

### Usage of components

- **Joystick Module** is used for controlling the snake (interacting with the game) and it's connected to ADC pins such that the analog voltage is converted to digital values.
- **Passive Buzzer** is used for *beeping* in various situations (sound feedback from the game).
- **Nokia 5110 Display** is used for displaying the game itself.
- **TM1637 Module** is used for keeping track of the score while playing.
- **Raspberry Pi Pico H** is used as the main component (microcontroller) responsible for processing input data.
- **Breadboard** is used for connecting every pin of the hardware components.
