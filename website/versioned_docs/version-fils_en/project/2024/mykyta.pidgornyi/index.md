## Description

The main Idea is to create a smart clock that displays not just time and weather, but also your PC's vitals such as ram and CPU usage. It also has a GPS module to define their position and make a query to the weather channel.  

## Motivation

I have Raspberry Pi 5 server at home. I host a website and a postgresql database on it so the problem of being aware of what's going on there is of vital importance for me. Right now I have to SSH + btop into my server all the time to see the system usage but after I get this clock done, I'll be able to just look on it from time to time to see how my rpi 5 feels. 

## Architecture 

Add here the schematics with the architecture of your project. Make sure to include:
 - what are the main components (architecture components, not hardware components)
 - how they connect with each other

**Raspberry Pi Pico WH**
- Microprocessor, this to connect everything all together

**GPS MODULE**
- Tracks the geoposition
- Will be connected to Pico using the driver mention below

**Base**
- Buttons
- Screen
- Breadboard
- Connects all components together

## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 6 - 12 May
Accepted the hardware. Assembled the scheme to make sure all components work properly.

### Week 7 - 19 May
Found the proper way of connecting components by using proper drivers, 
had to connect GPS tracker by doing I2C hardcode because it had no drivers.

### Week 20 - 26 May
Add software to the project repo. It is now possible to connect PC to the PICO and see all 
it's vitals and time on PICO's display. TCP via wifi in the local network is accomplished by using
PICO's cw43 WIFI module

## Hardware

RPi Pico WH RP2040- Microcontroller
DFRobot GNSS - GPS Module 
PICO EXPLORER BASE - The base for the clock with a display, buttons and a breadboard 

This is my whole digikey order:
