## Description

The project consists of a LED that turns on the light automatically when it detects movement and only when it is dark. Besides, it should still have its regular "lamp" function, so it will have a button to turn it on "smart" mode. 

## Motivation

I have chosen this project because I wanted to implement something that could turn into a bigger project later such as using a real lamp instead of a LED, or implementing new functions like (if I were to use a RGB LED) to add a remote controller to switch the colors of the light from far away.

## Architecture 
Components \
  -> Raspberry Pi Pico W: Microcontroller \
  -> Mini PIR HC-SR505 Sensor: Detects movement around the sensor \
  -> Photo Resistor: Used to detect the light intensity around the resistor 

Connections \
  -> Both the PIR HC-SR505 sensor and the photo resistor are connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico W \
  -> The LED is also connected to the Rapberry Pi Pico W \
  -> The buttons are connected to the LED and also to the Raspberry Pi Pico W in order to send a signal when to get the data from the sensor and photo resistor


## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 6 - 12 May
Managed to get all the components for the project and searched for documentation for each component.

### Week 7 - 19 May
Assembled all the hardware components together, did the KiCad schematic and started the software rust program.

### Week 20 - 26 May
In the last week, I made significant progress on the project software by implementing all the functionalities I wanted in the beginning. Lastly, I have added on GitHub the project and completed the Software Milestone.
