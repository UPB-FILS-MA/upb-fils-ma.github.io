## Description

A cryptocurrency price tracker built with Rust on a Raspberry Pi Pico WH, featuring a screen for monitoring real-time prices and daily percentage changes. It has a switch button for toggling between different currencies and provides price alerts with a buzzer. The project also includes a web application for remote monitoring.

## Motivation

I've been interested in cryptocurrencies for a long time and use price tracking apps regularly. I thought it would be awesome to build my own monitoring system with a microcontroller. This project lets me create a simple tracker with alerts for buying on desired price. Plus, it's a fun way to combine my passion for crypto with hardware and coding.

## Architecture 

![Architecture](architecture.jpg)

* Components 
  + Data Source: 
    The primary source of cryptocurrency data is the CoinMarketCap API. This is where the application fetches real-time prices and daily percentage changes for various cryptocurrencies. 
  + Microcontroller: 
    The Raspberry Pi Pico WH serves as the central processing unit, managing data retrieval, handling logic, and interfacing with other components. 
  + Display Screen: 
    A ST7735 LCD screen connected to the Pico WH shows the cryptocurrency price and daily percentage change. This is the main visual output for the tracker. 
  + Price Alert Buzzer: 
    A buzzer that emits an audible alert when a price threshold is reached. This is connected to the Pico WH and is activated based on predefined conditions. 
  + Switch for Currency Selection: 
    A toggle switch that allows the user to toggle between different cryptocurrencies. This connects to the Pico WH and interacts with the display and data-fetching logic. 
  + Web Server and Web Page: 
    A web server running on the Pico WH serves a simple web page. This web page allows remote monitoring of prices and setting of price alerts.

* Connections and Flow 
  + The Pico W fetches data from the CoinMarketCap API at regular intervals, typically using HTTP requests. This data is processed to extract the relevant price and daily percentage change. 
  + The screen is updated with the latest data, displaying the current cryptocurrency price and daily change. 
  + The toggle switch allows users to select which cryptocurrency to track, changing the request to the CoinMarketCap API accordingly. 
  + The buzzer is triggered when price alerts are activated. The alert thresholds are set via the web page, which communicates with the Pico WH through the web server. 
  + The web server running on the Pico WH allows users to access the tracker remotely through a web page, providing a convenient interface for monitoring prices and configuring alerts.

## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 6 - 12 May
I received the hardware package, verified its contents, and started assembling the components. 
### Week 7 - 19 May
I completed the hardware assembly. I finished the KiCad schematic and began developing the software. This involved work with LCD and creating structs CoinData and MarketData.
### Week 20 - 26 May
I decided to change the API from CoinMarketCap to CoinGecko, which would be more comfortable and would not have limitations.

On a software part, I have implemented a switch button, buzzer, LCD initialization and established Wi-Fi connection on a raspberry pi. I have wrote code for fetching data about bitcoin and ethereum from CoinGecko and displaying on the screen, also if the switch button would be pressed, we would see a switch between displaying currency.   


## Hardware

In my project I used a 1.8-inch SPI LCD with the ST7735 controller (128 x 160 px) to display cryptocurrency prices and daily percentage changes. The central microcontroller is the Raspberry Pi Pico WH. I used a breadboard for prototyping, a 3V active buzzer for auditory price alerts, toggle switch for switching between currencies and jumper wires to connect everything.

+ Display(data would be displayed in format "st7735 Pin -> Raspberry Pi Pin"):
  * VCC -> 3V3(OUT), pin 36
  * SCL -> GPIO 10, pin 14
  * SDA -> GPIO 11, pin 15
  * RES -> GPIO 12, pin 16
  * DC -> GPIO 8, pin 11
  * CS -> GPIO 9, pin 12
  * GND -> pin 38
  * BL -> None
+ Buzzer. The buzzer is connected to the GPIO 0(pin 1) and ground(pin3).
+ Push button. Pushbutton switch is connected to the GPIO 3(pin 5) and ground(pin 8).
